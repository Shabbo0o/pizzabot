# 💻 Code Overview
## pizzabot-prompt.js
This version of Pizzabot uses prompt() to interact with the user:
- **Pizza Menu**: Defines the available pizza types (vegetarian, hawaiian, pepperoni) and sets a base price per pizza.
- **orderPizza()**: Main function called when the "Order Pizza" button is clicked.
- Prompts for the pizza name and quantity.
- Checks if the pizza name exists (case-insensitive).
- Calculates total cost and estimated preparation time.
- Displays an alert summarizing the order details.
- **orderPrice()**: Calculates the total cost based on the quantity of pizzas ordered.
- **calculateOrderTime()**: Determines order time based on quantity:
- 1-2 pizzas: 10 minutes
- 3-5 pizzas: 15 minutes
- 6 or more pizzas: 20 minutes
## pizzabot-get-element.js
This version of Pizzabot uses getElementById and querySelector to interact with the user’s input on the HTML form:
- **orderPizza()**: The main function called when the "Order Pizza" button is clicked. It:
- Retrieves the selected pizza type using querySelector and the entered quantity using getElementById.
- Validates the quantity input to ensure it's greater than zero.
- Calculates total cost and estimated preparation time.
- Displays an alert summarizing the order details.
- **orderPrice()** and **calculateOrderTime()**: These functions perform the same role as in the prompt-based version.
